As a patient, I want to send a request for a prescription to my doctor and receive it on the app
without going there physically, so I can save time.

As a doctor, I want to specify which time slots of the day are eligible to be booked for a visit by a
patient, so that I can reserve some time of the day for other work related matters.

As an assistant, I want to cancel a patient’s appointment, so I can notify the patient of a change in
the doctor’s schedule.
