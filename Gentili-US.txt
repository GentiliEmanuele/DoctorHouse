• As a Doctor I want to be able to delete an appointment, so I can give more priority to an urgent
visit.
• As a Patient I want to reserve a visit, so I can know the time it’s my turn and I can reduce the time 
waste.
• As an Assistant I want to insert a visit, so I can book the visit for the patient without making him 
interact with the application. (e.g., elderly patients)
